#id: Unique ID for tracking feature counts, must not clash with gene names
#name: Human readable name used in Loupe Cell Browser
#sequence: Oligo-tag sequence attached to the antibody used for counts. Provided by sequencing group
#feature_type: Description of data type. Must match the labels available here:
	#https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/feature-bc-analysis#feature-types
#read: specifies if feature barcode is in R1 or R2. Most often in R2
#pattern: defines how to locate the barcode in the read sequence. Further reading:
